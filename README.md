# Programming for data analytics

This directory contains my work for the module Programming for Data Analytics in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).
 
This README follows the the instructions from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in how to write README files.

## About this project

This repository contains 3 different subdirectories:

- Assignments, that include my approach to the proposed practical assignments;
- Project;
- My work, that include work done regarding the labs.

## Purpose of this project

The main objective of this repository is to create programs that use many functions and libraries to explore data, and also visualize it in different ways. Other main goal is to reproduce new data and to apply programming structures.

## How to run this project

To analyse this data, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) need to be installed to run and visualise the data in any machine.
