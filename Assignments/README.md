# Programming for data analytics - Assignments

This directory contains my approach to the weekly assignments for the module Programming for Data Analytics in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).
 
This README follows the the instructions from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in how to write README files.

## About this project

I created a notebook for each weekly assignment, all containing a brief explanation of the tasks, the steps taken to do them and the references that help me in order to complete them.

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this work is to develop skills to create programmes that can load data and use many different functions to explore it. I also learned other valuable abilities like creating data and plots, and be able to solve problems with extensive search.

## How to run this project

To run the programs, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) need to be installed to run and visualise the data in any machine.
