# Programming for Data Analytics - Assignments

This directory contains my approach to the assignments for the module Programming for Data Analytics in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).
 
This README follows the instructions from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) on how to write README files.

## About this project

This subdirectory contains:

- 4 Jupyter notebooks:
    - [assignment2-weather.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment2-weather.ipynb), plots 2 variables of a DataFrame;
    - [assignment03-pie.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment03-pie.ipynb), generates a pie chart;
    - [assignment_5_risk.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment_5_risk.ipynb), simulates dice battles;
    - [assignment_6_Weather.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Assignments/assignment_6_Weather.ipynb), uses the known data to reproduce more new data and plots;
- and a [csv folder](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/tree/main/Assignments/csv), with the data downloaded for assignment 2.

Each notebook corresponds to one assignment, all containing a brief explanation of the tasks, the steps taken to do them, and the references that helped me to complete them.

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this work is to develop skills to create programs that can load data and use many different functions to explore and represent them. I also learned other valuable abilities like creating new data and being able to solve problems with extensive search.

## How to run this project

To run the programs, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) need to be installed to run and visualize the data on any machine.

The notebooks can be also run on a virtual machine through Google Colab:

## Dependencies

The [requirements.txt](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/requirements.txt) file, found in the root of this repository, indicates all the packages needed in order to run these programs. This file was generated through the command line with the code `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, as instructed by [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/blob/main/docs/python/managing-required-packages-with-requirements-txt.md). To download the packages on any machine, use the code `pip install -r requirements.txt`. After this, the programs should run easily on any computer.
