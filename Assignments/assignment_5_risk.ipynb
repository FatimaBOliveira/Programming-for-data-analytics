    "# Assignment 5 - Risk\n",
    "---\n",
    "Risk is a program that simulates 1000 individual battle rounds, where team attacker is composed with 3 dice and team defender with 2. The dice has 6 sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this program, the user can choose the number of battle rounds between attacker and defender, and also determinate the size of both teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules of Risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "In each battle round, the two top dice dice are compared, the attackers top dice roll with the defenders top dice. If the attackers dice is the same or lower, they loose that round, otherwise the defender looses. For the next round, the two highest dice from each side fight and same rule is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Round 1|Attacker: 6,4,1|Defender: 5,3|Score: 0,2| \n",
    "6 beats 5 and 4 beats 3 (the one is ignored as the lowest).\n",
    "\n",
    "Round 2|Attacker: 6,6,6|Defender: 6,3|Score: 1,1| \n",
    "Defenders 6 beats the attackers first 6 and the attackers second 6 beats the defenders 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Round 3|Attacker: 5,4,4|Defender: 5,4|Score: 2,0| \n",
    "The defenders 5 beat the attackers 5 and the defenders 4 beat the attackers 4 (defender wins when the dice are the same)."
