    "To simulate a battle, it's essential to create a function that defines what a battle is. At the start, attackers and defenders are composed of many dice rolls, and those teams can be generated through [rng.choice](https://realpython.com/numpy-random-number-generator/#selecting-array-elements-randomly), and after that, I requested the machine to print the teams. Then, I calculated the highest rolls for each team to fight, and after the second-highest dice rolls will face each other. Finally, the machine will print the results of those encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The battle function is dependent on 2 other functions, one to [calculate the second-highest dice roll](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16225677/get-the-second-largest-number-in-a-list-in-linear-time/16226049#16226049), second_highest, and another one, risk, to determine who was the winner in each round, the attacker or the defender, attributing points to each team.\n",
    "\n",
    "To [accumulate points](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74795154/how-to-add-points-to-a-player-in-python) from the risk function, new variables are needed, two variables with the attacker and defender points, another two with the victories and also one with the draws, so all of these can be counted in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to generate 1000 battles, I use a [for loop](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-repeat-a-function-in-Python), with the range representing the number of battles. Then to accumulate the points I checked how many points were received in each battle, and then added them together. Finally, the results are then printed."
