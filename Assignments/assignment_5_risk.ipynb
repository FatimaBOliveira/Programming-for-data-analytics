    "In Risk one army fights another. (using 6 sided dice). In each battle round, the attacker can put forward up to three of their troops (3 dice). The defender can use up to two of their defending troops (2 dice).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each side looses troops depending on the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "The two top dice dice are compared (ie the attackers top dice roll with the defenders top dice roll). If the attackers dice is the same or lower they loose one troop otherwise the defender looses a troop (ie if the attackers dice is higher). The next two highest dice from each side are then compared (ie the attackers second highest to the defenders second highest). If the attackers dice is the same or lower they loose one troop otherwise the defender looses a troop (ie if the attackers dice is higher)\n",

    "- Round 2: Defenders 6 beats the attackers first 6 and the attackers second 6 beats the defenders 3\n",
    "- Round 3: The defenders 5 beat the attackers 5 and the defenders 4 beat the attackers 4 (defender wins when the dice are the same)"
