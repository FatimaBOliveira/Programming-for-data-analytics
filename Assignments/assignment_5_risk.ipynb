    "### Generate battles\n",
    "To simulate a battle, it's essential to create a function that defines what a battle is. At the start, the teams, attacker and defender, are composed of many dice rolls, and those teams can be generated through [rng.choice](https://realpython.com/numpy-random-number-generator/#selecting-array-elements-randomly). After that, the teams can be printed but to confirm that the teams are being correctly generated, but because it's generating 1000 battles, I decided to not show them, otherwise the output will be very long. Then, I calculated the highest rolls and put them to fight each other, and checked the second-highest dice rolls to face each other too. Finally, the machine can print the results of those encounters to confirm, but again I hid these to have a short output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The battle function is dependent on 2 other functions, one to [calculate the second-highest dice roll](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16225677/get-the-second-largest-number-in-a-list-in-linear-time/16226049#16226049), second_highest, and another one, risk, to attribute points for each team in every round and count the battle victories and the draws. To confirm the results of these battles, the print function can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To [accumulate points](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74795154/how-to-add-points-to-a-player-in-python) from the risk function, new variables are needed, two variables with the attacker and defender round points, another two with the victories and also one with the draws, so all of these can be counted in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to generate 1000 battles, I used a [for loop](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-repeat-a-function-in-Python), with the range representing the number of battles. Then to accumulate the points, I checked how many points were received in each battle, and then added them to the variables. Finally, the results are then printed."
