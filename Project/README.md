# Programming for data analytics - Project

This subdirectory contains my project for the module Programming for Data Analytics in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).

This README follows the instructions from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) on how to write README files.

## About this project

This subdirectory includes:

- A Jupyter notebook, [climate.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Project/climate.ipynb), that analyses the weather conditions in Malin Head, based on the data collected by Met Ã‰ireann. I used various Python packages and techniques to explore the data and to generate new data, while adhering to the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) coding style. The Jupyter notebook also contains explanations of the code and references.
- the [csv](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/tree/main/Project/csv) folder, that contains the CSV data file used in the project and a txt file that explains the indices of the dataset;
- and the [img](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/tree/main/Project/img) folder, containing an image used in the notebook.

## Purpose of this project

The main objectives of this work are:
- find and use a data file that can be explored with Python;
- apply diverse packages and functions for data analysis;
- use the current data to generate new data, expanding the dataset with new insights;
- understand how various Python techniques work and explain the results obtained;
- develop a well-formatted and consistent coding style.

As a future Data Analyst, these skills are crucial in daily work, with the ability to analyse data with critical thinking. For example, this project shows that the studied area has favourable factors for the construction of efficient windmills.

## How to run this project

To use this project, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (VSC) need to be installed. After that, this subdirectory can be [cloned in VSC](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-dev-docs/blob/main/articles/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository.md) as instructed by Microsoft. After this, the notebook will be loaded into the machine and the code can be run.

Alternatively, the notebook can be run virtually in a cloud, through Google Colab at the following link:<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/Project/climate.ipynb">

</a> 

## Dependencies

The [requirements.txt](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/requirements.txt) file, found in the root of this repository, indicates all the packages needed in order to run the Python code. This file was generated through the command line with the code `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, as instructed by [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/blob/main/docs/python/managing-required-packages-with-requirements-txt.md). To run this project on any machine, clone this repository and download the packages through the terminal of VSC with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. After this, the project should run easily on any computer.

## Usage

Users can execute this project on their machines with the programs listed above, and ensuring that all dependencies are installed. To avoid issues, the notebook should be run sequentially from top to bottom, as most of the codes depend on each other and need to follow this running order to successfully work.
